# Auto-Price-Prediction
We are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. 
# Feature/Attribute Information :
# Symboling :-
Symboling refers to a numerical representation used by insurance companies to assess the risk associated with insuring a particular vehicle model. It's often used in the context of automobile insurance.
Generally, vehicles with higher symbol numbers are considered to have a higher risk of being involved in accidents or incurring higher costs for insurance companies, thus leading to higher insurance premiums for the owners.
A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.
# Normalized Losses :-
Normalized losses in automobile price prediction basically mean adjusting or standardizing the average losses that insurance companies face per year for each type of car. It helps make fair comparisons between different car models and their associated risks, which can affect how much insurance companies charge and, by extension, the prices of those cars.
# Car Company :-
The car company names from Japan, USA, Germany, France and Sweden.
# Fuel Type :-
Type of fuel used for the engine in the car,
Gas/petrol,
Diesel.
# Aspiration :-
Aspiration in automobile price prediction refers to how the engine gets its air for combustion. It's either "naturally aspirated," which means it breathes air without any extra help, or "turbocharged" or "supercharged," which means it gets extra air forced into it for more power.
std - Standard or Naturally Aspirated
Turbo - Use of Turbochargers or Superchargers
# No of Doors :-
The number of Doors a car has
two - 2 door car,
four - 4 door car
# Body Style :-
The Body shape of the car,
Convertible: Has a retractable or removable roof, providing an open-air driving experience. Convertibles are often associated with luxury and style, leading to higher pricing compared to similar non-convertible models.
Hatchback: Features a rear door that opens upwards to access the cargo area. Hatchbacks are known for their versatility and compact size, often appealing to budget-conscious buyers, impacting their pricing.
Sedan: This is a four-door passenger car with a separate trunk compartment. Sedans are often perceived as practical, family-friendly vehicles, and they may have a broad market appeal, impacting their pricing.
Wagon: Similar to a sedan but with a longer roofline and a larger cargo area. Wagons are valued for their practicality and additional cargo space, which can influence their pricing compared to sedans.
Hardtop : A hardtop body style in cars means that the roof of the car is made of a strong, solid material like metal or fiberglass, and it doesn't fold down or come off like a convertible roof. It provides good protection from weather and is secure, making the car look sleek and streamlined.
# Drive Wheels :-
Whether the engine drives the front or rear wheels of the car,
rwd - rear wheel drive,
fwd - front wheel drive,
4wd - 4 wheel drive drives all the four wheels at a time (in reality 4 wheel drive refers to switching between either front wheel drive or rear wheel drive)
# Engine Location :-
Placement of the engine with respect to the car,
front - engine is placed on the front,
rear - engine is placed on the rear
# WheelBase (in inches) :-
Wheelbase in automobile price prediction refers to the distance between the front and rear axles of a vehicle. It's an important measurement because it affects how stable the car feels on the road, how much space is available inside, and sometimes even how the car handles. A longer wheelbase often means more interior space but can make the car less maneuverable, while a shorter wheelbase can improve agility but may sacrifice some interior room.
# Length (in inches) :-
Length of the car in inches
# Width (in inches) :-
Width of the car in inches
# Height (in inches) :-
Height of the car in inches
# Curb Weight :-
Curb weight in automobile price prediction means how much a car weighs when it's ready to drive with all fluids and a full tank of fuel but without any passengers or cargo.
# Engine Type :-
DOHC: Dual Overhead Camshaft
DOHCV: Dual Overhead Camshaft with Variable Valve Timing
L: L-engine or Inline engine.
OHC: Overhead Camshaft
OHCF: Overhead Camshaft with Fuel Injection
OHCV: Overhead Camshaft with Variable Valve Timing
Rotor: A component of a Wankel engine, which is a type of rotary engine.
# Num of Cylinders :-
Refers to the numbers of cylinders in an engine
two - 2 cylinders
three - 3 cylinders
four - 4 cylinders
five - 5 cylinders
six - 6 cylinders
eight - 8 cylinders
twelve - 12 cylinders
# Engine size :-
It refers to the volume inside the engine cylinders where fuel and air are burned to produce power. It's usually measured in liters (L) or cubic centimeters (cc).
# Fuel System :-
The system which is used to flush/fill the engine with fuel during its operation
mpfi - Multi point fuel injection,
2bbl - Two barrel carburetor,
mfi - Mechanical fuel injection,
1bbl - One barrel carburetor,
spfi - Single point fuel injection,
4bbl - Four barrel carburetor,
idi - Indirect injection,
spdi - Sequential port direct fuel injection.
# Bore :-
It refers to the diameter of the cylinders in the engine where fuel and air are burned. A larger bore typically allows more fuel and air into the cylinder, which can result in increased power output.
# Stroke :-
It refers to the distance the piston travels inside the cylinder from top to bottom during each engine cycle. A longer stroke typically means more power and torque, but it can also affect fuel efficiency and emissions.
# Compression ratio :-
It refers to the comparison between the volume of the cylinder when the piston is at the bottom (largest volume) to when it's at the top (smallest volume). A higher compression ratio means the fuel-air mixture is squeezed more before ignition, which can lead to more power and efficiency but also requires higher-quality fuel.
# HorsePower :-
In the context of cars, horsepower is often used to describe the engine's power output, indicating how much work the engine can perform over time. The higher the horsepower, the more powerful the engine is considered to be, which often translates to better acceleration, higher top speeds, and the ability to handle heavier loads.
1 Hp = 745.7 watts
# Peak_RPM :-
It stands for the engine's highest revolutions per minute, which is the speed at which the engine's crankshaft rotates. It's the maximum speed at which the engine can operate effectively and produce the most power.
# City_mpg :-
It is a measure of how many miles your car can travel on one gallon of fuel when driving in city conditions, such as: Stop-and-go traffic, Frequent braking and acceleration, Lower speeds (e.g., 20-40 mph).
# Highway_mpg :-
It is about how many miles a car can travel on one gallon of fuel when driving on highways or open roads without many stops.
# Price :-
Price of the cars in dollars
